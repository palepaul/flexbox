# flexbox

Made a basic flex box example 

Added: 

1. Container class to the html file and then added display: flex to it in the css file

2. Added flex-direction: row, justify-content: space-around and align-items: center to this container

3. We also added the align-content property to this, though it should be noted that the flex-wrap: wrap property is necessary for the align-content property to work. 

4. Further in the box file added display: flex, justify-content: center and align-items: center

5. Finally in the individual boxes, for box two we added the align-self property to align it differently and then used the flex-grow property in all the boxes to size the differently, namely: box-1: flex-grow: 1, box-2: flex-grow: 2 and box-3: flex-grow: 3
